# Data Types 
Java defines eight simple (or elementary) types of data: 
1. byte
2. short
3. int
4. long
5. char
6. float
7. double
8. Boolean



## In Java, here’s a summary of the primitive data types, their sizes, and usage:

### Primitive Data Types in Java:

1. **byte**:  
   - Size: 1 byte (8 bits)
   - Range: -128 to 127
   - Usage: Useful for saving memory in large arrays, mainly in place of integers when the data is within a specific range.

2. **short**:  
   - Size: 2 bytes (16 bits)
   - Range: -32,768 to 32,767
   - Usage: Also useful for saving memory in large arrays and can be used in place of int when the data fits within this range.

3. **int**:  
   - Size: 4 bytes (32 bits)
   - Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
   - Usage: Default integer type. Used when precise values are not required and within the given range.

4. **long**:  
   - Size: 8 bytes (64 bits)
   - Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
   - Usage: Used when a larger range than `int` is needed, like for very large calculations.

5. **float**:  
   - Size: 4 bytes (32 bits)
   - Range: Approximately ±3.40282347E+38F (6-7 significant decimal digits)
   - Usage: For single-precision floating-point values, typically used when less precision is acceptable to save memory.

6. **double**:  
   - Size: 8 bytes (64 bits)
   - Range: Approximately ±1.79769313486231570E+308 (15 significant decimal digits)
   - Usage: Default type for decimal values. Used for precise values in floating-point calculations.

7. **char**:  
   - Size: 2 bytes (16 bits)  
   - Range: 0 to 65,535 (Unsigned Unicode characters)
   - Usage: Represents a single 16-bit Unicode character. Suitable for storing characters like letters or symbols.

8. **boolean**:  
   - Size: 1 bit (the exact size in memory can vary)
   - Values: `true` or `false`
   - Usage: Used for simple flags that track true/false conditions.
