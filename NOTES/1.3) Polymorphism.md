# Polymorphism 
**Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass**. This enables a single interface to represent different underlying forms (data types), essentially allowing the same method or operator to behave differently based on the object it is acting upon.

## Polymorphism can be classified into two main types:

1. **Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism**: Achieved through method overloading.
### 1. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the **same name** but **different parameters** (either by number, type, or order of parameters). The compiler determines which method to call based on the method signature.

2. **Run-Time (Dynamic) Polymorphism**: Achieved through method overriding.

### 2. Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)
Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. Run-time polymorphism is achieved through method overriding, where the method to be called is determined at run time based on the object type.

## Summary
Polymorphism allows for dynamic and flexible code by enabling multiple implementations of the same interface. It provides two major forms:
1. **Compile-Time Polymorphism** (Method Overloading): Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
2. **Run-Time Polymorphism** (Method Overriding): Subclass-specific implementations of a method in the superclass, enabling different behaviors based on object types.

Using polymorphism, Java provides a powerful tool to create flexible, reusable, and maintainable code, which can adapt and extend as the system grows.
