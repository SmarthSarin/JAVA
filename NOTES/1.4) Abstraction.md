# Abstraction 
Abstraction in hiding complex implementation details 
and showing only the essential features of an object. 
In simpler terms, abstraction helps to reduce complexity by focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. 
This is useful in situations where the internal workings of a system are not necessary for the user to understand 
but the actions or behaviors are.


### Key Points of Abstraction:

1. **Simplifies complex systems**: Abstraction reduces complexity by removing unnecessary details and exposing only the relevant information.
2. **Encourages modularization**: It allows developers to break down systems into smaller, manageable parts.
3. **Increases code reusability**: Abstract classes and interfaces can define behaviors that can be implemented differently by subclasses.

### Real-world Example:

Consider a `CoffeeMachine` at a caf√©. As a user, you don't need to know how the machine heats the water or mixes coffee grounds to make a cup of coffee. 
You only need to press a button to get your coffee. This button-pressing interface is an abstraction of the underlying, complex coffee-making process.

### Abstraction in Java:

In Java, abstraction can be achieved in two main ways:
1. **Abstract Classes**
2. **Interfaces**

#### 1. Abstract Classes:
An **abstract class** can have both abstract (without implementation) and concrete (with implementation) methods. 
It cannot be instantiated directly, meaning you cannot create objects of an abstract class. 
Instead, subclasses must inherit from it and implement the abstract methods.




**Example:**

```java
// Abstract class
abstract class Animal {
    // Abstract method (does not have a body)
    public abstract void sound();
    
    // Regular method
    public void sleep() {
        System.out.println("The animal is sleeping");
    }
}

// Dog class extends Animal and provides implementation for the abstract method
class Dog extends Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks");
    }
}

// Main class to test abstraction
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog(); // Create a Dog object
        myDog.sound(); // Outputs: The dog barks
        myDog.sleep(); // Outputs: The animal is sleeping
    }
}
```




In this example:
- `Animal` is an abstract class with an abstract method `sound()`. 
- `Dog` is a concrete subclass that provides the specific implementation of `sound()`.
- The `sleep()` method in `Animal` is a regular method and does not need to be redefined in the subclass.

#### 2. Interfaces:
An **interface** is a completely abstract class that defines a set of methods that a class must implement. All methods in an interface are by default abstract (before Java 8) and public. Interfaces provide a way to achieve multiple inheritance, as a class can implement multiple interfaces.




**Example:**

```java
// Interface
interface Animal {
    void sound(); // Abstract method
    void eat(); // Abstract method
}

// Dog class implements the Animal interface
class Dog implements Animal {
    public void sound() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks");
    }

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("The dog is eating");
    }
}

// Main class to test interface abstraction
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myDog = new Dog(); // Create a Dog object
        myDog.sound(); // Outputs: The dog barks
        myDog.eat();   // Outputs: The dog is eating
    }
}
```




In this example:
- The `Animal` interface declares two methods, `sound()` and `eat()`.
- The `Dog` class implements the `Animal` interface and provides specific implementations for both methods.



### When to Use Abstraction
- When you have multiple classes with similar behaviors but different implementations, such as various animals with unique sounds.
- When you want to provide a common interface for different parts of an application.

By using abstraction, Java allows you to define functionalities in a flexible, reusable way, making it easy to expand and modify your code without affecting existing systems.
