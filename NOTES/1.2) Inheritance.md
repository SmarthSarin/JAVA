# Inheritance
**Inheritance allows one class to **inherit** properties and behaviors from another class.** Inheritance enables code reuse, modularity, and the creation of a class hierarchy, where classes share attributes and methods in a structured way.

Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a feature that allows one class to inherit the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class. Itâ€™s like a parent-child relationship, where the child class (subclass) automatically has access to the features of its parent class (superclass). Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a logical hierarchy among classes.

## Key Points of Inheritance:
1. **Parent (or Superclass)**: The class that provides its properties and methods to other classes.
2. **Child (or Subclass)**: The class that inherits from another class.
3. **`extends` Keyword**: Used in Java to indicate inheritance.

## Benefits of Inheritance:
- **Code Reusability**: Common code is shared across classes, reducing duplication.
- **Hierarchical Classification**: Classes can be organized into hierarchies, making code organization logical.
- **Easy Maintenance**: Changes in the superclass automatically propagate to subclasses, making maintenance easier.
- **Extensibility**: New features or behaviors can be added in subclasses without altering the superclass.

## Types of Inheritance
In Java, inheritance is limited to **single inheritance** (a class can inherit from only one superclass) due to the **diamond problem** (ambiguity with multiple inheritance). However, a class can implement multiple interfaces, which is a way to achieve a similar effect.

## Summary
Inheritance in Java allows for:
1. **Code Reusability**: A superclass can define attributes and behaviors that are reused in subclasses.
2. **Polymorphism**: Through method overriding, subclasses can provide specialized behavior.
3. **Hierarchical Relationships**: Superclass-subclass relationships establish a hierarchy of classes, which makes code organization more logical and maintainable.

By using inheritance wisely, you can create modular, extensible code that is both easier to maintain and scalable.
