# Definition of OOPS

Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPS) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects,"
which can contain data (in the form of fields, often known as attributes) and code (in the form of methods).
OOPS focuses on organizing code into reusable components (classes) that model real-world entities and
their interactions, promoting modularity, reusability, and scalability in software development.

Key Features of OOPS:

1. Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some components.
2. Inheritance: Allowing a class to derive properties and behavior from another class.
3. Polymorphism: Enabling methods or objects to take on multiple forms, such as method overloading and overriding.
4. Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features.

Languages that are **not object-oriented** or do not primarily follow the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm
are typically **procedural** or **functional programming languages**. Here are a few examples:

---

## **1. Procedural Languages:**

- Focus on a step-by-step approach to solve problems.
- Use functions, sequences, and loops without the concept of classes or objects.

Examples:

- **C**: A procedural programming language where everything revolves around functions and data structures, not objects.
- **BASIC**: Early versions are purely procedural.
- **Pascal**: Primarily procedural, though some modern versions add object-oriented features.

---

## **2. Functional Languages:**

- Centered around mathematical functions.
- Avoid mutable data and state changes, focusing on pure functions.

Examples:

- **Haskell**: A purely functional programming language with no OOP features.
- **Lisp**: Primarily functional but supports other paradigms.
- **Erlang**: Focuses on functional programming for concurrent systems.

---

## **3. Assembly Language:**

- Operates directly on hardware and lacks high-level programming constructs like classes or objects.

---

## 4. Scripting and Markup Languages

- **HTML**: A markup language, not a programming language.
- **CSS**: A styling language for web pages, not related to OOP.
- **Shell Scripting (Bash)**: Procedural, with no OOP concepts.

### Notes

Many modern languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) support multiple paradigms, including OOP.
 However, languages like **C**, **Haskell**, and **Assembly** do not inherently follow OOP principles.
