# Encapsulation
Encapsulation binds together the **data** (attributes) and **methods** (functions) that manipulate that data, 
within a single unit, known as a **class**. 
The main objective of encapsulation is to hide the internal state of an object 
and protect it from unauthorized or unintended access, a principle known as **data hiding**.

Encapsulation allows a class to expose only what is necessary to the outside world, 
typically through **public methods** while keeping internal data **private**. 
This makes classes easier to manage, more secure, and reduces dependencies within the code.

## Key Benefits of Encapsulation:
1. **Data Protection**: By keeping data private, you ensure that it is accessed 
and modified only in controlled ways.
2. **Modularity**: Encapsulated classes are self-contained, making it easier to understand, 
debug, and maintain code.
3. **Controlled Access**: Access to data can be controlled through methods, 
which helps in adding validation or custom logic.
4. **Flexibility and Maintenance**: Changes in the internal implementation don’t affect other parts of the code,
as long as the public methods remain the same.

## Summary
Encapsulation in OOP helps to:
1. Protect the internal state of an object.
2. Provide controlled access to an object’s data through methods.
3. Make the class more flexible and maintainable by separating the implementation from the interface.

By encapsulating attributes and exposing controlled access points, you can ensure that your classes are used correctly and that sensitive data is safeguarded against invalid modifications.
